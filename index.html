            Hey, I'm Rachel! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
            I find joy in every aspect of the creative process, 
            whether I'm diving into personal projects that challenge my skills, 
            partnering with clients to transform their visions into reality, 
            or collaborating with teammates to tackle complex problems in innovative ways.
            <br> </br>
            I'm that person who loves diving into everything from tricky tech problems to creative marketing campaigns and eye-catching designs. 
            I get genuinely excited about new tools and ways to make things work better. Every project is a chance to create a new strategy, 
            and learn something cool. My journey's been pretty diverse, picking up all sorts of skills along the way, and I genuinely wouldn't have it any other way.​​​
            <br> </br>
            When I unplug, you'll find me hunting for new adventures and soaking up inspiration for new ideas. 
            Living abroad has given me some of my most precious memories, 
            and I'm a firm believer that life's best moments happen outside our comfort zones.​
            <br> </br>
            I bring that same explorer's mindset to my work—whether I'm wandering through a new city 
            or working with my team to make a clients ideas into reality, I'm always excited to discover something new.

              <li>This was one of the most comprehensive websites I've collaborated on in terms of planning and development. 
                I contributed to the sitemap development, strategy, web development, and SEO optimization processes. 
                The client prioritized creating an intuitive design while showcasing the diverse attractions of the Finger Lakes region 
                - a task that required careful consideration to properly represent this multifaceted destination.
                Our goal was to increase visibility for the area's locations, activities, and businesses throughout the Finger Lakes.

                    requiring extensive planning and strategic implementation. I contributed to the content strategy 
                    and development process to create an intuitive platform serving families, childcare providers, 
                    and educators across three counties. Working closely with Child Care Council, 
                    we developed a solution that connects stakeholders with community-specific resources while showcasing their full spectrum 
                    of services - from provider training to family support programs.</li>

                    Working closely with their enthusiastic team, we achieved a clean, minimalist layout that not only improved user experience but also delivered
