            Hey, I'm Rachel! <img src="html_finalprojimages/waving-hand.png" width="60px"/>
          </h1>
          <p>
              I'm the type of person who loves diving into everything from tricky tech problems to creative marketing campaigns and eye-catching designs. 
              I get genuinely excited about new tools and ways to make things work better. Every project is a chance to create a new strategy 
              and learn something cool. My journey's been pretty diverse, picking up all sorts of skills along the way, and I genuinely wouldn't have it any other way.
              <br></br>
              When I unplug, you'll find me hunting for new adventures and soaking up inspiration for new ideas. 
              Living abroad has given me some of my most precious memories, 
              and I'm a firm believer that life's best moments happen outside our comfort zones.
              <br></br>
              I bring that same explorer's mindset to my work—whether I'm wandering through a new city 
              or working with my team to make a client's ideas into reality, I'm always excited to discover something new.

              This project stands out as one of the most comprehensive website collaborations I’ve been part of, spanning strategy, 
              planning, development, and SEO optimization. I played an active role in developing the sitemap, shaping the overall strategy, executing web development 
              efforts, and tracking KPIs after launch. The main priority was crafting an intuitive design that engaged users and effectively showcased the 
              diverse attractions of the Finger Lakes region—a challenge that required thoughtful planning to authentically represent the area’s rich variety. 
              Our ultimate goal was to enhance the visibility of the region’s locations, activities, and businesses, ensuring a broader reach and deeper engagement 
              across the Finger Lakes.

              The Child Care Council website required thorough planning and strategic execution to meet the needs of families, 
              childcare providers, and educators across three counties. I contributed to the content strategy, UX design, development and ongoing marketing efforts to create a 
              user-friendly platform that fosters seamless connections. Collaborating closely with the Child Care Council team, we developed a solution 
              that links stakeholders to essential community resources while highlighting the full range of services—from provider training to family 
              support programs—ensuring accessibility and engagement for all users. The project delivered impressive results through continuous refinement and data-driven improvements, 
              resulting in a 52% increase in resource engagement within the first six months of launch.

              The Ferris Agency website redesign aimed to simplify their complex information architecture 
              to drive conversions. I collaborated on transforming their insurance website from a convoluted 
              structure into a cohesive, user-focused design, participating in content creation, development, 
              and continuous SEO optimization efforts. The project prioritized strategic lead generation through 
              the integration of contact forms on each pillar page.
              Working closely with their enthusiastic team, we achieved a clean, minimalist layout that significantly 
              improved user experience while delivering measurable results, including increased direct and organic traffic metrics. 
              Through usability testing and continuous iteration, we ensured the design struck the perfect balance between functionality 
              and aesthetics, resulting in a 48% increase in lead generation over six months.
